Title: Data Sharpening
Version: 1.3
Author: W.J. Braun 
Description: Functions and data sets inspired by data sharpening -
             data perturbation to achieve improved performance in
             nonparametric estimation, as described in Choi, E., Hall, P. 
             and Rousson, V. (2000) <doi:10.1214/aos/1015957396>.  
             Capabilities for enhanced local linear regression function 
             and derivative estimation are included, as well as an 
             asymptotically correct iterated data sharpening estimator
             for any degree of local polynomial regression estimation. 
             A cross-validation-based bandwidth selector is included which,
             in concert with the iterated sharpener, will often provide 
             superior performance, according to a median integrated squared 
             error criterion.  Sample data sets are provided to illustrate 
             function usage.
